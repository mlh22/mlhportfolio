      <h2 class="display-3">Background</h2>
      <p>In order to gain practical experience with AB Testing, we were given an online shopping website for buying cacti.
        We were given two identical versions, A and B, of the website, and were asked to modify them so that A and B had a 
        defining difference. Using data from visitors to the different versions of the website, we then were to conclude 
        which design produced statistically significant results that improved traffic on the website. In essence, this 
        assignment was a small-scale version of AB-testing.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="tested-sites">
      <h2 class="display-3">Website Designs A and B</h2>

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>The above images are the two versions of a website deployed as a means of allowing users to buy cacti. We were 
        given the task of determining, using data collection and statistical analysis, which of two designs was more optimal 
        for users and why. This was done by assigning a task to all users and measuring completion time for the task, as well 
        as the rate at which a user returned to the shopping page after completing the task.

          <h3>Null Hypothesis</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Time to Completion: Changing the layout of the way products are listed on a shopping website will have no effect 
              on the time users spend browsing through and interacting with items on the page.</li>
            <li>Return Rate: Changing the layout of product listings on a website will have no impact on whether or not users 
              will return to the website; they will or will not return for personal reasons outside of the website design itself.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col hypo-box">
          <h3>Alternate Hypothesis</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Time to Completion: As compared to version B, which is closer to the original website provided in the stencil, 
              users will spend less time on version A since the elements are aligned horizontally such that users can see all of 
              the elements better. For specificity, I would like to see at least a 50% decrease in the time taken for design A as 
              opposed to that of design B.</li>
            <li>Return Rate: In the same vein, users will likely return to version A more since the layout is less conducive 
              towards summing a total of values and due to uncautioned speed. We are used to adding values as we go down the page, 
              so adding vertically may cause more miscalculations, leading to a higher return rate to fulfill the task.</li>

        <div class="col data-box">
          <p>
          In order to gain insight on the usability of the website, fellow students were tasked with placing an order 
          of cacti valuing at least $150. In a large-scale study, I would ideally like to expand test users to other demographics. 
          </p><br>
          <p>
          There are a couple of pitfalls of having a large number of students in a class as a data sample set. While it is easy 
          to collect data because we are already given a large group of users, all of the students in the class had the same 
          A/B test assignments, and were submitting data for multiple cactus-buying websites with mock products. Thus, the 
          data found may not be fully accurate. Additionally, designs are usually tailored towards specific user, and students 
          are not necessarily representative of the full market of cactus buyers.

            <p>
            After obtaining the logs from the deployed website, I sorted through the data and completed several calculations 
            in order to obtain information on how long users took to navigate through the website and complete the task, and 
            how many users did or did not return to the shopping page. I also made sure to remove extremities in the values.

          <div class="col-7 col-sm-7 col-md-5 col-lg-5 mx-auto align-self-center log-box">
            <p>With these values, I wrote a Python program to display p-score values for each parameter. For completion 
              time I utilized two sample t-testing, and for return rate I used chi-squared testing. From this I obtained the 
              following values:
              <ul>
                <li>t score for completion time: about -1.44838</li>
                <li>p score for completion time: about 0.08906</li>
                <li>chi squared value for return rate: about 0.91667</li>
                <li>p score from return rate: about 0.33835</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col align-self-center log-box-last">
          <br>
          <p>Based on the results and our baseline (significance level) around a p-score of 0.05, I was unable to reject the null hypothesis 
            because for both parameters, the p scores were larger than 0.05.
            <br>
            Completion time does come very close though...

          <ul>
            <li>I felt that a huge limitation to the data collected for this project, as mentioned before, is 
              the fact that students were asked to click through other students' (admittedly similar) websites in one 
              sitting, leading to some skewing of data in terms of clickthrough speed.
            </li>
            <li>The above point speaks towards good principles in design testing, where you generally do want a user 
              who has less experience with something. Being that many designs for this cactus-purchasing website were similar, 
              users may have already become accustomed to the general functionality of the site. Thus, it is important to have 
              new users testing everything.
            </li>
            <li>Websites are generally quicker to navigate when there is a logical, chronological order to navigate them.</li>
            <li>Interpreting logs can actually be surprisingly subjective. My own readings of logs were based more on the very 
              last time a user loaded a page, which took priority over the final interaction on the page.
            </li>
            <li>In general, A/B testing is a powerful tool but only when you know what users to test on and when you are 
              willing to sit down and crunch numbers to analyze data.
