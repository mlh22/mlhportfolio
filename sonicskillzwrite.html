                This program was created as a final project for a software engineering course I took. I worked 
                alongside three other lovely individuals, all of whom had more experience than I. This project 
                not only was an incredible opportunity to learn from my team and apply course knowledge in a practical 
                context, but was also the reason how I ended up rediscovering my passion in computer science.

                We've all played the game before - someone plays a random song and guessing the correct songs helps 
                you win the game. This game - which my team and I creatively called the "Guess the Song Game" - has 
                been played on well-known talk shows, at parties, with friends, and is a generally fun game. The game 
                is much harder to play, however, in a time of social distancing and awkward lags on video conferencing 
                apps. As game enthusiasts and music lovers, my team and I set out to recreate an online version of the 
                game that would not only allow multiple people to play, but would also auto-generate a playlist tailored 
                to the specific users in the game to create a mix of varied interests, allow for music discovery, and 
                allow everyone to join in and play.

                While this program was born from a final project, there was nothing very "final" about this project. This 
                assignment was an opportunity for all of us to learn new developer techniques that we hadn't learned in 
                class. This project resembled many firsts for me:

                <h5>Server-Client Interaction: </h5> 
                <p>An important segment lending to the multiplayer 
                functionality of this project was creating the connection between server and client. The server would 
                allow for simultaneous running of all games,, while the client would keep track of a user's music 
                information, user data, and game information.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col mainparts-col">
                <h5>JavaScript: </h5>
                <p>Before this project, I very much lacked experience in using JavaScript, 
                    and so as I coded, I picked up some of the semantics and language.</p>

                <h5>API Usage: </h5>
                <p>We chose to use the Spotify API in order to gain information on a user's 
                    music taste in order to create the <strong>playlist generating algorithm</strong>, which will be detailed 
                    in the next section. Spotify had lots of data points available, and because of this and its overwhelming 
                    popularity, we decided it would be the best authenticator and API to use for our game.</p>

                <p>As per the assignment, we were asked to focus our programs on a central algorithm, and ours was 
                    our own original playlist-generating algorithm. The purpose of this algorithm was to generate 
                    playlists that would allow for fair gameplay for all players. We generate this playlist using 
                    a user's Spotify data, as well as a set database of songs for users who do not have sufficient 
                    Spotify data.

            <p>The initial prototype of our game had featured Sonic Skillz as a main server to host two games: Guess

        <div class="changes-text">
            <p>As we developed the project, many of our initial ideas, either due to time constraints or change in 
                thinking, morphed into something new. 
                <ul>
                    <li>Initially, we wanted to create two games for the app; however, we decided that spending more 
                        time developing one well-fleshed-out algorithm would be better move as opposed to creating two 
                        algorithms that are less substantial
                    </li>
                    <li>We originally wanted to use a voting system to determine wins, where a guesser would make their 
                        guess and other players would vote on whether or not the correct answer was given. We later decided 
                        to incorporate a short spell-checking and name-normalizing algorithm so that the program, rather 
                        that other players, can check for correct answers. We tested this substantially so that we could 
                        account for edge cases in song names, such as if a song had a "(remix)" appended at the end of the 
                        title, or if other artists' names showed up as features.
                    </li>
                    <li>Two days before we were due to present our full project, Spotify crashed entirely. With this 
                        sudden crash, we decided for future reference to quickly depend on Spotify only for API information, 
                        and switched to using a webplayer to play the songs in the game.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        As opposed to the initial idea of a waiting screen, other players are instead able to listen to 
                        the song the guesser must figure out, and they are told the name of the song while it is not their turn.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <p>Creating this project, especially in the midst of a global pandemic, was incredible difficult 
                and time-consuming but I was able to bring a lot of ideas to my team just as they brought lots 
                of ideas and knowledge to me. From this project, I grew as a programmer both in skill and in 
                self-confidence level, and I hope to create more substantial projects like this one in the future!
