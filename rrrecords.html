      <h2 class="display-3">The Assignment</h2>
      <br>
      <div class="describe">
        <p>For this assignment, we were asked to develop a list-based application and incorporate an aggregator function, all 
          using React. React is a programming language combining elements of Javascript and HTML/CSS to asynchronously render 
          components of an application - in other words, loading different parts of an application webpage at different times 
          depending on set changes that occur in the application.
          <br>
          <br>
          Being a music enthusiast, my instinct was to incorporate my love for music into this assignment by emulating and 
          creating a record shop application. I aimed to create a project that had hints of a retro feel, but had a clean, 
          timeless design. I gathered names of albums that I or friends I knew enjoyed across three different genres, and 
          put together a bunch of properties and potential filtering ideas that I could use.
          <br>
          <br>
        </p>
        <p class="h4 text-center">The problem, however? I hardly knew anything about how to create a React application.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="organization">
      <h2 class="display-3">The Organization</h2>
      <br>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-8 col-sm-7 col-md-6 mx-auto">
          <img src="./images/rrrecords/structure.png" alt="organization of components within the application" class="img-fluid align-self-center">
        </div>
        <div class="col-8 col-sm-7 col-md-6 mx-auto org-box align-self-center">
          <p>In order to develop this application, I had to put a lot of thought into how components would 
            communicate with one another. The diagram depicts the flow of information between my components. The App 
            component handles the main rendering, and sends the list of records to the filtered list component, which 
            filters the list based on given parameters, and sends the filtered list to the sorted list class. This class 
            sorts the products accordingly and sends them to the albums component to be rendered. The cart, meanwhile, 
            receives the shopping list as well as related functions. The cart component acts as a div to hold information 
            about pricing and totals, and sends information to the cart items component for rendering.

        <div class="col-8 col-sm-7 col-md-6 mx-auto style-words-box align-self-center">
          <p>
          My main goals with the design were to incorporate both timeless contemporary styles and retro designs. While the 
          layout of the website is very clean with neatly-organized divs and cards to hold products and elements, the font 
          for the title, as well as depiction of record players, funky colors, and use of gradients bring in the older feel. 
          Additionally, I wanted to focus on album art, and the design as it is now gives the feel of shopping for vinyl 
          records, with large square images reminiscent of record sleeves. </p>

    <div class="struggles-main">
      <h2 class="display-3">The Struggles</h2>
      <br>
      <div class="struggles">
        <p>In learning how to program in React, I encountered quite a few issues. My main struggles were with the asynchronous 
          updating of states in React. Having come from a Java/Python background, I was much more used to single-threaded 
          languages, where the code I wrote would run chronologically, and the next line of code would not be called until 
          the previous line has completed running. Thus, adjusting to the asynchronous rendering methods of React was tricky 
          because I would often call methods on a state after I had set it. This would often lead to the previous version of 
          the state being used in my methods, resulting in many, many odd results. However, once I became adjusted to React, I 
          picked up on this rendering style by making sure that I relied less on operating directly on state objects and focused 
          more heavily on pulling the information from the state beforehand, completing my operations without direct use of 
          state objects, and then setting the state.

            (2020s, 2010s, 2000s, or pre-2000)</li>
          <li>Aggregation of the total number of songs, total number of albums, and prices based on calculations using songs 
            and quantity</li>
          <li>Accessibility was highly prioritized - I made sure to be very clear with information provided and 
            provided extreme detail within alt tags </li>
          <li>Responsive design elements were also heavily used in this project</li>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col takeawaybox">
          <p><strong>Structure!!</strong> Because all of the states exist in the App component, there needs to 
            be strong communication between components in the application to pass along vital information.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col takeawaybox">
          <p><strong>Accessibility!!</strong> My application (as well as many other applications) are heavily visual experiences, which can 
            abandon lots of users. Thus, using descriptive, meaningful alt tags, spacing elements out effectively, and 
            maintaining hierarchal structure can go a long way in making programs accessible for others.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col takeawaybox">
          <p><strong>Asynchronous redering!!</strong> This was my first time using React, and this project gave me an opportunity to work with 
            this language and expand the logical thinking I had developed with previous coding experiences to the component 
            structure here.
